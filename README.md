Credit Risk & Fraud Sentinel: Advanced Underwriting Visualization

Project Overview

In the modern fintech landscape, credit risk management has evolved beyond simply assessing a borrower's "Ability to Pay." Today, the primary challenge is verifying the "Authenticity of the Applicant." This project is a Single-Page Application (SPA) infographic designed to visualize the convergence of fraud detection and credit underwriting. It explores how financial institutions are transitioning from traditional bureau-based scoring to multi-layered decision engines incorporating alternative data and behavioral biometrics.

The Problem Statement

As of 2025, global fraud losses are projected to reach $5.4 Trillion. Specifically, Synthetic Identity Fraud—where criminals combine real SSNs with fake names—now accounts for billions in losses because these identities often pass traditional credit screenings with an 85% success rate. This project visualizes the data-driven defenses required to mitigate these risks.

Key Features & Insights

The Threat Landscape: A comparative analysis of the 150% YoY surge in Account Takeover (ATO) attacks vs. traditional fraud.

The Synthetic Growth Curve: Temporal tracking of losses associated with "Frankenstein" identities.

The Data Spectrum: A Radar analysis comparing the predictive power of Traditional Bureau Data vs. Alternative Data (Telco, Device Intelligence, and Cashflow).

The Decision Engine Flow: A comprehensive visualization of a modern, multi-layered underwriting architecture.

Friction-Risk Scatter Plot: An analysis of the "Dynamic Friction" paradox—balancing user experience with security depth.

Technical Stack

This is a lightweight, high-performance SPA built with a focus on modern UI/UX and responsive data visualization:

Frontend Framework: HTML5 & Tailwind CSS (Utility-first styling)

Visualization Engine: Chart.js (Canvas-based rendering for high-performance interactive charts)

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Design Principles: Material Design aesthetics with a "Fintech-Modern" vibrant color palette.

Technical Implementation Details

Responsive Chart Containers: All visualizations are contained within dynamic wrappers to ensure 100% responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

Label Processing: Implemented custom logic to handle multi-line string wrapping for complex data labels, ensuring readability on small screens.

Canvas Rendering: Optimized for performance by utilizing the HTML5 Canvas API via Chart.js, avoiding the overhead of heavy SVG-based libraries.
